  "summary": "The diff demonstrates comprehensive implementation of all three requirements. REQ-11 (website name update to 'SahityaAurShabd') is fully implemented across Layout.tsx header/footer, LanguageContext translations, and index.html page title. REQ-12 (colored map background) is implemented in IndiaMap.tsx with a background image layer at 30% opacity. REQ-13 (refined card positioning) shows adjusted position coordinates for all 37 state/UT cards to align with the background map geography. All acceptance criteria appear to be addressed based on the available evidence.",

## Summary
**Goal:** Update website branding to "SahityaAurShabd", add a colored India map background, and align clickable state cards with geographic regions.

**Planned changes:**
- Update website name to "SahityaAurShabd" in header logo, page titles, and all branding elements
- Add a colored political map of India as a background layer behind the clickable state/UT cards
- Refine positioning of state/UT cards to precisely align with their corresponding regions on the background map
- Ensure responsive alignment across different screen sizes

**User-visible outcome:** Users will see the rebranded "SahityaAurShabd" website with an enhanced IndiaMap component featuring a colored geographic map background that aligns with the interactive state/UT cards, making it easier to recognize and select regions.
